STACKS: PYTHON
Stacks Python Review
Nice work — you’ve built out a Stack class that can:

add a new item to the top via a push() method
remove an item from the top and returns its value with a pop() method
return the value of the top item using a peek() method
allows a stack instance to maintain an awareness of its size to prevent stack “overflow”
So how does your code stack up against pizza delivery?

Instructions
1.
Uncomment the push() and pop() statements at the bottom of your code to see your Stack class help a pizza delivery place efficiently manage delivering a stack of pizzas.
